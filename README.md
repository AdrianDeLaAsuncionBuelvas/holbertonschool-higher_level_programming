#### Install PEP8
Pycodestyle is now the new standard of Python style code, but at school we will use PEP8, version 1.7.* Donâ€™t worry, pycodestyle is based on pep8. The hardest part now is to install it for Python 3:

#### Regular Ubuntu 14.04 install
`$ sudo apt-get install python3-pep8`

#### Using Pip3
##### Install Pip3
`$ sudo apt-get install python3-pip`

#### Install Pep8
`$ pip3 install pep8`

Make sure you have the right version
```
$ pep8 --version
1.7
$
```
