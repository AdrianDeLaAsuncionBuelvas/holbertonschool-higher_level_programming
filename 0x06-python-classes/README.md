### Description
OOP is a totally new concept for all of you (especially those who think they know about it :)). Itâ€™s VERY important that you read at least all the material that is listed bellow. As usual, make sure you type (never copy and paste), test, and understand all examples shown in the following links (including those in the video). The biggest and most important task of this project is the reading. The project itself will not take you more than 2-3 hours if you take the time to read and understand everything.

Read or watch the below resources in the order presented.
